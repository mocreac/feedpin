# Feedpin

Annotate any live web page. Copy the output. Paste it into Claude Code, Codex, or whatever agent you use. It knows exactly what to fix.

Feedpin is a Chrome extension that lets you pin comments on UI elements and export them as structured text with CSS selectors, HTML tags, and page context. Built for teams that use AI coding agents in their review workflow.

## Install

Chrome Web Store listing coming soon.

**Manual install:**

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode**
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the repo directory

## How it works

1. Click the Feedpin icon to activate
2. Hover over any element to see it highlighted with its element type
3. Click to pin a comment
4. Hit **A** to copy all annotations
5. Paste into your agent, ticket, or chat

Each annotation captures the CSS selector, the element's opening HTML tag (with all classes and attributes), and a text preview. An AI agent reading the export can see exactly which element you're referring to and map it back to your source code.

## Export format

```
Design Review - Page Title
URL: https://example.com/page
Viewport: 1440×900

1. [list item] nav.main-nav > ul > li:nth-of-type(3)
   In: nav
   HTML: <li class="flex items-center gap-6 px-4 py-2 text-sm">
   Text: "Products"
   Comment: Spacing between nav items is inconsistent, should be 16px

2. [heading 1] #hero-heading
   In: main > section
   HTML: <h1 class="text-5xl font-light text-gray-700">
   Text: "Welcome to Our Platform"
   Comment: Font weight looks lighter than the design spec
```

The viewport line helps AI agents understand which breakpoint you were reviewing at. The HTML tag line is what makes this work across any framework. Tailwind, CSS modules, BEM, styled-components - the agent sees the actual classes on the rendered element and can grep your codebase for them.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| **C** | Toggle comment mode |
| **A** | Copy all annotations |
| **Shift+A** | Copy all & clear |
| **XXX** | Delete all annotations |
| **Z** | Undo delete (5s window) |
| **Esc** | Close / exit comment mode |

### Keyboard navigation

Enable keyboard navigation in the in-page menu (click the sliders icon on the toolbar). When active in comment mode:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| **Arrow keys** | Move selection spatially (up/down/left/right) |
| **Shift+Up/Down** | Select parent or child element |
| **Tab / Shift+Tab** | Cycle through elements in DOM order |
| **Enter** | Annotate the selected element |

This lets you select a card container vs. the text inside it, which matters for precise design review.

## Pin contrast

Pins automatically adapt to the background behind them. On light backgrounds they gain elevation shadow for depth. On warm/orange backgrounds close to the pin accent color, pins shift to an indigo palette so they stay visible.

## Extension menu

Right-click the Feedpin icon or click it to open the popup:

- **Enabled** toggle to disable Feedpin on the current site
- **Dev only** mode to restrict Feedpin to localhost, 127.0.0.1, and .local domains

The in-page config button (sliders icon) opens a settings panel with:

- **Keyboard navigation** toggle
- Full keyboard shortcuts reference

## Multiple annotations per element

Click the same element multiple times to add multiple comments. All annotations on one element open together in the popover, each with its own numbered badge. Deleting any annotation renumbers the rest sequentially.

## Works everywhere

- Any HTTP/HTTPS page, any codebase
- Single-page apps (detects client-side navigation)
- Annotations persist per page in localStorage
- Highlight follows the cursor during scroll
- CSS selector builder filters out generated class names (CSS-in-JS, Tailwind hashes, etc.)
- Pin colors auto-adapt to page backgrounds for visibility
- Pins stay visible at viewport edges (clamped positioning)
